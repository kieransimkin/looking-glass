 * form's display property.
 * 
 * @param { function. } onFocus - event handler that is triggered when the search box
 * gains focus.

 * prevents the default submission behavior and logs the search term to the console
 * before redirecting to the appropriate page.
 * 		+ `autoComplete`: A boolean value indicating whether the input field should
 * display a dropdown menu with possible search terms (set to "on" by default).
 * 		+ `noValidate`: An boolean value indicating whether the form should be marked
 * as invalid if the search term is empty (set to "true" by default).

 * 			- `display`: A string value indicating the display type of the form (set to
 * "flex" by default).
 * 			- `width`: A number value indicating the width of the form (set to 600 pixels
 * by default).
 * 		- `<TextField>`: An instance of the `TextField` component that contains the
 * search input field.
 * 		+ `inputProps`: An object containing properties for the input field, including:
 * 			- `autoComplete`: A boolean value indicating whether the input field should
 * display a dropdown menu with possible search terms (set to "on" by default).
 * 			- `onChange`: An event handler that is called when the user types in the input
 * field (uses `searchChange` function).
 * 			- `onFocus`: A function that is called when the user focuses on the input field
 * (uses `onFocus` function).
 * 			- `onBlur`: A function that is called when the user loses focus from the input
 * field (uses `onBlur` function).
 * 			- `type`: A string value indicating the type of input field (set to "search"
 * by default).
 * 			- `id`: A string value indicating the ID of the input field (set to "search"
 * by default).
 * 			- `label`: A string value indicating the label for the input field (sets to
 * "Search by Policy ID, Wallet Address or ðŸ’²handle" by default).
 * 			- `name`: A string value indicating the name of the input field (set to "search"
 * by default).
 * 			- `variant`: A string value indicating the variant of the input field (set to
 * "outlined" by default).
 * 			- `fullWidth`: A boolean value indicating whether the input field should take
 * up the full width of its parent element (set to "true" by default).
 * 		- `<IconButton>`: An instance of the `IconButton` component that contains the
